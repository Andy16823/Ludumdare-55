# Orbital Defence: Tower Tactics

is a 2D tower defence puzzle game that takes you into a world full of strategic challenges. Your task is to survive in a single, epic round against a multitude of enemy towers that summon orbs and threaten your base.

The special thing about this game is that you not only defend, but also attack. You have the option of summoning orbs and using them specifically against the enemy towers. But be careful: timing is everything! Only if you send out the right orbs at the right time can they reach the enemy tower and cause damage.

In this intense one-on-one game, you'll need to carefully plan and adapt your tactics to win. Use your strategic skills to fend off enemy attacks and defend your base. Are you ready to put your tower tactics to the test and master orbital defence?

You have a choice of 4 maps and can also create your own maps in Aesprite or a similar pixel tool.

## How to play the game
Once you have selected a map in the launcher, you can play it. The principle is simple. Each tower in the game collects resources over time. The towers also receive resources when their minions destroy an opponent's orb or hit the opponent's tower.

Enemy towers release an orb every 30 resources, which flies towards your tower. You can fend them off with your orbs. There are 3 different orbs that you can summon using the number buttons. 

### Key 1 - Minion Orb: This orb has very little life, but gives you 35 resources when you destroy an enemy orb. It is therefore suitable for collecting resources.

### Button 2 - Towerbuster Orb: This orb also has very little life and is immediately destroyed when it collides with another orb. However, it does a lot of damage to the enemy tower (120 damage).
