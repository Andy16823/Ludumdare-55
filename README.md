# Orbital Defence: Tower Tactics

## About the game
is a 2D tower defence puzzle game that takes you into a world full of strategic challenges. Your task is to survive in a single, epic round against a multitude of enemy towers that summon orbs and threaten your base.

The special thing about this game is that you not only defend, but also attack. You have the option of summoning orbs and using them specifically against the enemy towers. But be careful: timing is everything! Only if you send out the right orbs at the right time can they reach the enemy tower and cause damage.

In this intense one-on-one game, you'll need to carefully plan and adapt your tactics to win. Use your strategic skills to fend off enemy attacks and defend your base. Are you ready to put your tower tactics to the test and master orbital defence?

You have a choice of 4 maps and can also create your own maps in Aesprite or a similar pixel tool.

## How to play the game
Once you have selected a map in the launcher, you can play it. The principle is simple. Each tower in the game collects resources over time. The towers also receive resources when their minions destroy an opponent's orb or hit the opponent's tower.

Enemy towers release an orb every 30 resources, which flies towards your tower. You can fend them off with your orbs. There are 3 different orbs that you can summon using the number buttons.

## How to create own maps
You can create your own maps using Aseprite or any other programme that can be used to edit and create pixel data. The map is generated from the colour data of the pixels. Note that an object is created for each pixel. This means that you have to define the colours for each pixel.

After you are done with creating the map you can save it as png and put it into the maps folder.

#### Wall
Colour code RGB: 0,0,0

#### Floor
Colour code RGB: 255, 255, 255

#### Player tower
Colour code RGB: 251, 242, 54<br />
(Only 1 player tower is allowed on the map)

#### Opponent tower
Colour code RGB: 91, 110, 225
