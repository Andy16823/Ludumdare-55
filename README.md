# Orbital Defence: Tower Tactics

is a 2D tower defence puzzle game that takes you into a world full of strategic challenges. Your task is to survive in a single, epic round against a multitude of enemy towers that summon orbs and threaten your base.

The special thing about this game is that you not only defend, but also attack. You have the option of summoning orbs and using them specifically against the enemy towers. But be careful: timing is everything! Only if you send out the right orbs at the right time can they reach the enemy tower and cause damage.

In this intense one-on-one game, you'll need to carefully plan and adapt your tactics to win. Use your strategic skills to fend off enemy attacks and defend your base. Are you ready to put your tower tactics to the test and master orbital defence?

You have a choice of 4 maps and can also create your own maps in Aesprite or a similar pixel tool.
